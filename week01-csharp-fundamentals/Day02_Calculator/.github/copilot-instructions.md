# Copilot / AI agent instructions — RekenMachine

This repository is a small .NET 10 console application. The goal of these instructions is to help an AI coding agent be immediately productive when making changes or adding small features.

Keep it short and actionable:

 Project type: C# console app (TargetFramework: net10.0) — see `RekenMachine.csproj`.

Build & run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Debug
dotnet run --project .\RekenMachine.csproj
```

Files worth reading for context:

- `RekenMachine.csproj` — project configuration (net10.0, implicit usings, nullable).

If anything in this file is unclear or you'd like more examples (launch.json for VS Code, recommended unit test structure, or a sample fix for `Program.cs`), ask and I'll iterate.
